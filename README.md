# Introduction to Java

## Object Oriented Coding:
It is a principle that code written as Objects is useful in mimicking the world.
An object has "Data Types" called "Classes". These objects are instances of the class. The objects are called User-Defined variable.

While programming in C when ever we actually create a variable is created in the "STACK" part of the RAM. The HEAP is used to store name, address, id, etc. Where as the CODE part stores the Source code. Note these Code is stored in the RAM.
Objects are stored in the HEAP segment.All objects are 'instances' of the class. The Class is a blue print for creating the Object.

Core Principles of OOPs:
- Inheritance
- PolyMorphisum
- Encapsulation

### Benifits of OOPs:
- Reusablility
- Modularity
- Mantainance

## Starting with JAVA
- Write Once Run Anywhere
- Platform independant
- Object Oriented 
- Simple & Familier (*I don't know WHY??*)
- *System.out.println("Hello World");*
