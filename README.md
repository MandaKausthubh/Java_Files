# Introduction to Java

## Object-Oriented Coding
It is a principle that code written as Objects is useful in mimicking the world.
An object has "Data Types" called "Classes". These objects are instances of the class. The objects are called User-Defined variable.

While programming in C when ever we actually create a variable is created in the "STACK" part of the RAM. The HEAP is used to store name, address, id, etc. Whereas the CODE part stores the Source code. Note these Code is stored in the RAM.
Objects are stored in the HEAP segment.All objects are 'instances' of the class. The Class is a blueprint for creating the Object.

Core Principles of OOPs:
- Inheritance
- PolyMorphism
- Encapsulation

### Benefits of OOPs:
- Re-Usability
- Modularity
- Maintenance

## Starting with JAVA
- Write Once Run Anywhere
- Platform independent
- Object Oriented 
- Simple & Familiar (*I don't know WHY??*)
- ``System.out.println("Hello World");``

## Design of JAVA

### Shortfall of C, C++
- Existence of pointers ???
- Fixed memory size for Arrays
- Very bad error/ exception handling
- Too little libraries
- Poor securities as you can access(read) data at other data points

### Rise of Java
- Huge set of Libraries
- Removes complex pointers and arrays
- Introduces JVM which secures the restricted data locations
- Just In Time Compilation.
- OOPs !!! < I don't know why? >
- Multi - Threading
- Async Programming 
- Java Applets were the first web dev thing??
- Distributed Computing
